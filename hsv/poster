Subject: A tool for inclusion into youre library.

Hi Fred,

A friend of mine asked me to send you the following Utility
he wrote. Its the uuencode file at the end of this mail.
The .lha archive contains all files Binaries & Source.

The program was tested on :

	Amiga 2000B + 2630 and Kick 2.04
	Amiga 2000A        and Kick 3 (39.106).

The program is a nice help for people who prefer HSV above RGB.

I hope you will include it into youre library.

William Wanders.
